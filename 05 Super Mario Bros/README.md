# Super Mario Bros

The fifth exciting project in the intro to game development course allows to create a 2D platformer with the **lua** programming language and the **love2D** game engine.

The video, for reference, is available [right here](https://youtu.be/_cPwFo--1LA).

The game inspiring the project is **Super Mario Bros**. Its dynamics are deceptively straightforward: control a character on a 2D plane, have it move, jump, collect points and hit enemies. Behind this simple look however, the game offers plenty of complexity and opportunities to learn.

## Topics

- tile maps. The game world is made up entirely of tiles, which need to be positioned on the screen according to specified coordinates.

- 2D animation. The character is animated when it moves and jumps, to emulate a more realistic change.

- procedural level generation. Levels are be created on the basis of tile maps to be entirely random.

- platformer physics. The game is set to react to the position of the character vis a vis the surrounding tiles.

- basic AI. The enemies introduced in the game are set to pursue the character.

- powerups. The character is scheduled to become more powerful as powerups are collected.
