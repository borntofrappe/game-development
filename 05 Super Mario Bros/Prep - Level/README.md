# Procedural Level Generation

Levels are generated by including conditions and flags when populating the world with different tiles. This is similar to the Match 3 game, or even Breakout, when certain conditions are put into place. Instead of having tiles of the same color or bricks of different colors and tiers however, here we want to include different _types_ of tiles.

Think of a condition including a chasm, by skipping tiles making up the ground for an entire column.

- using `tiles.png` and `tile_tops.png`

- positioning the top exactly where the sky ends;

- looping through the tiles and updating the tiles being used when typing r.
