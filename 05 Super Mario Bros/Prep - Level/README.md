# Procedural Level Generation

Levels are generated by including conditions and flags when populating the world with different tiles. This is similar to the Match 3 game, or even Breakout, when certain conditions are put into place. Instead of having tiles of the same color or bricks of different colors and tiers however, here we want to include different _types_ of tiles.

Think of a condition including a chasm, by skipping tiles making up the ground for an entire column.

- using `tiles.png` and `tile_tops.png`

- positioning the top exactly where the sky ends;

- looping through the tiles and updating the tiles being used when typing r.

## Update 0 - Tiles & Tops

In the first update the appearance of the world is altered whenever pressing `r`. To achieve this feat, **tiles.png** and **tile_tops.png** are introduced to style the ground and the first layer of ground tiles respectively.

I decided to update `Util.lua` as to extract the precise information for both use cases. With the commented functions, it is possible to create a reference to a table aptly describing every type of tile and every type of top.

By additionally setting up a variable (instead of a constant), it is possible to reference a value which can be updated as needed. In the specific instance of the update, this variable is updated to draw from both tables, at random. This has the effect to draw different patterns, but it is on its own trivial. The idea is to ultimately have the level change in appearance as it is generated, to have the character spawn in a setting changing constantly.
