# Animation

While I have already made a first attempt in animating the character, but rapidly changing the stance trhough a dedicated variable, the lecturer includes animation through a custom class, in `Animation`.

## Update 0 - animation.lua

I tried to comment the **Animation.lua** as much as possible, to understand the inner logic of the class, but here I'll also add a few notes jotted down while reviewing the video.
