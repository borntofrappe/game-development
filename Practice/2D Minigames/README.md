# 2D Minigames

The goal of this project is to create a series of independent games inspired by the series <i>Wario Ware</i>. The games are developed in sub-folders, and allow to practice with different sections of the Love2D API. That being said, the ultimate goal is to incorporate every game in a larger title running the smaller demos one after the other.

## Detonate

Press a specific key, in this instance the enter key, to have the firework detonate in the designated area. The demo features Love2D particle system, three particle systems actually, to highlight the movement and explosion of the firework, in and outside the target area. In terms of difficulty, consider updating the game in terms of the size or position of the target, or again the speed of the firework.
