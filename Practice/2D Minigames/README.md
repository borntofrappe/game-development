# 2D Minigames

The goal of this project is to create a series of independent games inspired by the series <i>Wario Ware</i>. The games are developed in sub-folders, and allow to practice with different sections of the Love2D API. That being said, the ultimate goal is to incorporate every game in a larger title instantiating the smaller demos one after the other.

## Detonate

Featuring Love2D particle system, both for the trail of the projectile and the explosion of the firework.

The difficulty of the game can be customized through:

- the speed of the firework

- the size of the target
