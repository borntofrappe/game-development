# Missile Command

Defend Cairo.

## Notes

[Missile Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command) is a rather popular arcade game where you are tasked to defend a few targets from incoming missiles. This is achieved by launching missiles from a couple of basis, to intercept the projectiles.

Here I try to develop the game taking inspiration from the Game Boy port. I am focused on recreating the structure of one of the game's level, where you defend the city of Cairo, with two launch pads of 15 missiles each and six towns or cities to defend.
