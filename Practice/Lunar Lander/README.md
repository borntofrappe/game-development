# Lunar Lander

Safely land a module on one of the platforms intersposed between jagged surface.

## Prep

The `Prep` folder includes a series of smaller demos to independently work on the game's main features. In `Terrain` I lean on random functions to produce the jagged surface. In `Box2D Module` I introduce the lander with the physics library and as a series of shapes attached to the same module.
