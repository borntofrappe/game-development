# Match Memory

Ask the player to match cards in pairs.

## Resources

In the `res` folder you find a spritesheet describing the different types of pokemon. The visual is inspired by the symbols highlighted [on bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type#Symbol_icons) for the pokemon ranger series. Each tile is sized `24` by `16` pixel, with 18 types, plus an extra card with a question mark and one describing the back of the card.
