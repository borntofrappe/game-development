# Match Memory

Ask the player to match cards in pairs.

## Resources

In the `res` folder you find a spritesheet describing the different types of pokemon. The visual is inspired by the symbols highlighted [on bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type#Symbol_icons) for the pokemon ranger series. There are eighteen tiles sized `24` pixel wide and tall.

## Suggestions

Pokemon types have a hierarchy, with some overpowering others. In light of this, the game could be updated to consider not matching the cards in pairs, but relative to this hierarchy. Picking fire, for instance, would require you to look for grass, or again ice. The biggest hurdle would be how to guarantee that the game can be completed.
