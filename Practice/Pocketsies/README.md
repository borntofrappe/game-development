# Pocketsies

Try to pocket every single colorful ball in a basic game of pool.

## Box2D

The project leans on the physics library Box2D as provided by Love2D in the `love.physics` module.

## Canvas

The table and the six pockets are static and I prefer to include the drawing instructions in a canvas.
