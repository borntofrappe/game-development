# Target Practice

A two-player game with a simple task: destroy your opponent before it destroys you.

## Prep

In the `Prep` folder I try to develop the building blocks for the final project.

- `Terrain` explores how to render the game's terrain and cannoball holes

- `Physics` considers projectile motion with the Box2D
