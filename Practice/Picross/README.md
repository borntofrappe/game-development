# Picross

Develop the basics of the game picross, a puzzle game in which the player fills a grid based on the instructions given on the side of the rows and columns of a square. The goal is to ultimately draw a stylized picture based on the pixelated structure.

## Resources

The `res` folder includes the static assets used in the game, and also `Timer.lua`, a small library I created to manage time events.
