# Pockets

Try to pocket every single colorful ball in a physics-based game of pool.

## Box2D

The project helps to practice with the Box2D library, covering such topics as dynamic objects, chain shapes, sensors and collision callbacks.

The balls are attributed tentative values in terms of restitution and linear damping, with the goal of having the objects do move, but slow down rapidly so that the player can continue with a new launch.
