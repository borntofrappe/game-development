# Grand Prix

## Notes

[Grand Prix](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_(video_game)>) is a video game developed for the Atari 2600 where you are tasked to move horizontally, avoid other drivers, water hazards and reach an arbitrary goal. Here I try to implement the game to rehearse with:

- textures and quads to render the vehicles and the background

- sprite animation to have the vehicles slightly animated

- horizontal scroll and camera focus, whereby the camera is fixed on the player

- collision detection to have the player slow down when leaving the track, or again hitting another car, or again facing the water hazard
