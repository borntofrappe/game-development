# Side Operation

A version of Flappy Bird where you navigate the screen vertically and try to avoid the left and right walls. You are pushed to the side following a variable force of gravity.

## graphics

`side-operation.png` describes the overall appearance of a level. Background, wall, strip and player. The idea is to duplicate the wall on either side, but show the strip only on one side, the one where the gravity pulls the player away from the center.
