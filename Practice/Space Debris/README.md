## Resources

- push library. Essential to round the coordinates of the pixelated textures

- graphics with a solid fill

- sounds to trivially enhance the gameplay

## Particle system

- dedicated class

- linear acceleration, emission area

## Collision detection

- aabb collision detection

- compute the coordinates of the overlap (to be improved)
