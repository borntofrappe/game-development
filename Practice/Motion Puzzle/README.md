# Motion Puzzle

[Motion Puzzle](https://serebii.net/mini/puzzle/#motion) is a game developed for the Pokemon Mini system where you are tasked to swap the pieces of a picture until you complete the original design. The goal of this project is to replicate the basic concept starting from a spritesheet and a couple of levels.

## Sprite Batch

First introduced in `Practice/Excavation`, the concept of a sprite batch helps to efficiently render a series of visuals. In `main.lua`, the feature helps to render the tiles making up the background.
