# Motion Puzzle

[Motion Puzzle](https://serebii.net/mini/puzzle/#motion) is a game developed for the Pokemon Mini system where you are tasked to swap the pieces of a picture until you complete the original design. The goal of this project is to replicate the basic concept starting from a spritesheet and a couple of levels.
