# pong-ai

A "game" of pong where two AI-controlled paddles try to make up for the lost time.

- pick a side to support

- the chosen side receives the ball

- the winner takes double the points if it was **not** chosen

- you win if, by the end of the game, you've chosen the right side more often than not

- game ends at 8
