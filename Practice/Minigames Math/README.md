# Minigames Math

The goal of this project is to practice with basic math with a series of independent games. Ultimately, I might incorporate the multiple demos in a larger title inspired by the <i>Wario Ware</i> series, and similarly to `Minigames Box`.

## Detonate

Press a specific key, in this instance the enter key, to have the firework detonate in the designated area. The demo features Love2D particle system, three particle systems actually, to highlight the movement and explosion of the firework, in and outside the target area. In terms of difficulty, consider updating the game in terms of the size or position of the target, or again the speed of the firework.

## Escape

Move around the screen while avoiding an arbitrary number of moving obstacles.
