[The assignment](https://docs.cs50.net/ocw/games/assignments/2/assignment2.html) has the following objectives:

- add a powerup to the game that spawns two extra `Ball`s

- grow and shrink the `Paddle` when the player gains enough points or loses a life

- add a locked `Brick` that will only open when the player collects a second new powerup, a key, which should only spawn when such a `Brick` exist and randomly as per the `Ball` powerup
