# Flappy Bird â€” Final

With respect to the last increment, `Flappy Bird 12`, the final update includes the following:

- add mouse controls to move between states

- in the play state, have the bird jump on mouse press regardless of the actual coordinates

- ensure that the pipes do not exceed the window's top and bottom edges

- spawn a pipe pair immediately instead of waiting for the first iteration of the interval
