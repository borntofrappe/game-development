The sixth installment goes through a top-down dungeon-crawler inspired by The Legend of Zelda.

## Topics

- top-down perspective

- infinite dungeon generation

- hitboxes (areas in which an entity inflicts damage) and hurtboxes (areas where the entity can be hurt by a hitbox)

- events, executing a chunk of code following a determined action/happenstance

- screen scrolling, transitioning between two different levels

- data-driven design, whereby the engine builds the game based on data
