# Match Three 8 - Board

With the different states of the game set up, minus the `LevelState`, it is time to incorporate the board as developed in updates 1, 2, 3 and 4. The `LevelState` also depends on the score achieved while playing, so it is a good idea to postpone its development once the scoring system is set up. <!-- I could fake scoring reacting to a selection of the key presses though -->
