Consider the [assignment for Match 3](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2019/spring/assignments/3/).

- [ ] Implement time addition on matches, such that scoring a match extends the timer by 1 second per tile in a match

- [ ] Ensure Level 1 starts just with simple flat blocks (the first of each color in the sprite sheet), with later levels generating the blocks with patterns on them (like the triangle, cross, etc.)

  - [ ] These should be worth more points, at your discretion

- [ ] Create random shiny versions of blocks that will destroy an entire row on match, granting points for each block in the row

- [ ] Only allow swapping when it results in a match

- [ ] (Optional) Implement matching using the mouse
