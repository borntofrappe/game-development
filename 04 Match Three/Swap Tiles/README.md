# Swap

Diving into the dynamics of the match 3 game, we begin by creating a grid of shapes which can be selected and swapped. The feature is developed in steps, from creating the grid out of the `match.png` graphic, to allow a swap to occur between selected shapes and finally to enable tweening in said transition.
