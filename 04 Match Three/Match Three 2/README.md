Remove matches.

## removeMatches

When `self.matches` refers to the tiles creating a match, visually removing the tiles is a matter of setting the variables to `nil`.

```lua
for k, match in pairs(self.matches) do
  for j, tile in pairs(match) do
    self.tiles[tile.y][tile.x] = nil
  end
end
```

Just remember to reset the table to avoid removing the tiles in the same position.

```lua
self.matches = {}
```

This is enough, but the existing codebase requires two changes.

### pairs vs ipairs

`ipairs` works swimmingly with sequences â€” tables without holes, `nil` values. In the moment values are set to `nil`, its behavior is rather unpredictable and leads to entire rows behind removed from view.

Since the position of the tiles is described by two of its fields, `x` and `y`, it's safe to to `pairs` instead.

### Timer.tween

As soon as the board is created, it is safe to remove the tiles immediately.

```lua
function Board:init()
  -- initialize board

  if self:updateMatches() then
    self:removeMatches()
  end
end
```

When swapping two tiles however, you risk to remove the tiles before the animation has had a chance to update the tiles' own coordinates.

Chain a `:finish` function to `Timer.tween` to remove the proper tiles.

```lua
Timer.tween(
  -- details
):finish(
  function()
    if self:updateMatches() then
      self:removeMatches()
    end
  end
)
```
