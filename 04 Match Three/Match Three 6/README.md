# Match Three 6 - Time Based Events

With this update I set out to implement a couple of timers, in order to:

- have the colors of each letter in the **Match 3** title rapidly change one after the other;

- have a timer displayed in the `PlayState`, counting down an arbitrary amount of time, and increasing in value when pressing a specific key. Here's the additional feat: have the timer move the game to the gameover state upon hitting 0.
