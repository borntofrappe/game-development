The fourth video moves on to create a game in which you match tiles of the same shape and color.

## Topics

- anonymous functions

- tweening

- timers

- clearing matches

- procedural grids

- sprite art and palettes

## Project structure

The game is developed in increments, but there are also additional folders to discuss dedicated topics:

1. _Timer_ details how to consider time events

2. _Tween_ describes how to interpolate between values over time

3. _Chain_ illustrates how to have multiple operations in sequence
