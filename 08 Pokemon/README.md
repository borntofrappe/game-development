The eight title in the course introduces the genre of RPGs by looking at the Pokemon series.

## To dos

- [style] consider modifying the sprites by removing the shadows

- [code] refactor dialogue state to receive text in its init function

## Topics

- state stacks, an alternative to state machines

  The idea is to have a series of states _stacked_ one atop the other. Consider for instance having a field state, displaying the level, and a dialog state displaying a message above the level.

- turn-based systems

- graphical user interfaces, or GUIs, presenting information in panels, text boxes

- RPG mechanics, like damage, experience points

## Project structure

The game is developed in increments, but the folder describes other demos to introduce relevant concepts. Consider for instance `StateStack`.
