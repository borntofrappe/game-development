**Goal**: Go through the games in [CS50's Intro to Game Development](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbluXJKKbCIb4xd7fcRkpzoz) to learn about game development.

## Topics

- 2D game development

- the programming language [**Lua**](https://www.lua.org/)

- the game engine [**Love2D**](https://love2d.org/)

## How to run a game

Provided you have installed love2D, launch the games from the command line with the following instruction:

```bash
"C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe" "C:\Games\Space Invaders"
```

The first string describes the location of the executable behind love2D, and the second string details the folder with the customary "main.lua" file.

You can also drag and drop the folder on top of the file describing the executable itself.

## Repo structure

### XY — Game

In the numbered folders, I follow the course to recreate the presented games. Following the lecturer's example, the games are developed one feature at a time, and are explained by a dedicated markdown file.

Each game also includes at least two additional folders:

1. "Game — Final"

2. "Game — Assignment"

The first one describes the state of the game at the end of each lecture, while the second one adds the features listed in the lecture's assignment.

### Games

In the "Games" folder, I try to solidify the concepts introduced in the course by developing additional games. These can be a variant of the proposed game — refer to "2 Player Pong" and "Bouncing Android" — or different games altogether — see "Whirlybird" and "Space Invaders".
