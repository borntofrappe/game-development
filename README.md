The goal of this repo starts out simple: follow [this introduction course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbluXJKKbCIb4xd7fcRkpzoz) to learn about game development.

In the numbered folders, I follow the course to recreate the presented games.

In the _Games_ folder, I repeat the concepts by creating either a variant of the proposed games, or new games altogether.

## Topics

- 2D game development

- the programming language [**Lua**](https://www.lua.org/)

- the game engine [**Love2D**](https://love2d.org/)

## Project structure

- _Game \*_ folders develop the games one feature at a time. Each _README.md_ file describes how the code changes, and the lessons learned throughout.

- _Game — Final_ summaries the game at the end of the course

- _Game — Assignment_ adds the features requested for the game's assignment
