# Game Development

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo starts out simple: follow [this introduction course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbluXJKKbCIb4xd7fcRkpzoz) to learn a bit about game development. 

## Why

Reasons. Kidding aside and at the top of my head:

- to practice with a different coding environment. A different language in [**Lua**](https://www.lua.org/), a different engine in [**Love2D**](https://love2d.org/).

- to learn a new skill;

- to get acquainted with approaches and methodologies I can possibly incorporate in my web development 'master branch', so to speak;

- yes, to also entertain.

I plan to document the progress heavily, incorporating any resource beside the cited playlist.
