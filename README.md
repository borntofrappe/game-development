# game-development

- in the numbered folders I develop the games discussed in [CS50's Intro to Game Development](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbluXJKKbCIb4xd7fcRkpzoz), in increments and documenting the process as much as possible

- in the `Practice` folder I create additional games to practice

- in the `Utils` folder I keep a few helper projects
