# Game Development

The goal of this repo starts out simple: follow [this introduction course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbluXJKKbCIb4xd7fcRkpzoz) to learn a bit about game development.

In the numbered folders, I follow the course to recreate the presented games.

In the **Games** folder, I continue to practice by creating either a variant of the proposed games, or new games altogether.

## Reasons

To learn:

- game development

- the programming language [**Lua**](https://www.lua.org/)

- the game engine [**Love2D**](https://love2d.org/)

To entertain a productive endeavor, and who knows, maybe to hit publish on a finished game.
