# game-development

With this folder I set out to explore in the alluring world of game development, starting from [CS50's Intro to Game Development](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbluXJKKbCIb4xd7fcRkpzoz).

In the numbered folders I develop the games introduced in the course. In the `Practice` folder I create additional demos to solidify the lessons learned.

Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/borntofrappe/game-development/wiki) for more information.
