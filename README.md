# game-development

With this folder I set out to explore in the alluring world of game development, starting from [CS50's Intro to Game Development](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbluXJKKbCIb4xd7fcRkpzoz), and continuing with lots of practice.

If you are interested in the project, or just want to try one of the games, [the wiki is a good place to start](https://github.com/borntofrappe/game-development/wiki).
