The goal of this repo starts out simple: follow [this introduction course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbluXJKKbCIb4xd7fcRkpzoz) to learn about game development.

In the numbered folders, I follow the course to recreate the presented games.

In the _Games_ folder, I repeat the concepts by creating either a variant of the proposed games, or new games altogether.

## Topics

- 2D game development

- the programming language [**Lua**](https://www.lua.org/)

- the game engine [**Love2D**](https://love2d.org/)

## Project structure

- _Game \*_ folders develop the games one feature at a time. Each _README.md_ file describes how the code changes, and the lessons learned throughout.

- _Game — Final_ summaries the game at the end of the course

- _Game — Assignment_ adds the features requested for the game's assignment

## Launch games

Provided you have installed love2d, you can launch the games from the command line

```bash
"C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe" "C:\Games\Space Invaders"
```

The first string describes the location of the executable behind love2d, the second string details the folder with the necessary entry point in "main.lua".
