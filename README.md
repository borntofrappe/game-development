# game-development

The repository of an aspiring game developer, starting from [CS50's Intro to Game Development](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbluXJKKbCIb4xd7fcRkpzoz) and creating interactive demos. Lots and lots of demos.

## Project structure

[The wiki](https://github.com/borntofrappe/game-development/wiki) is a good place to start, but here's a few pointers starting from how the repository is organized:

- in the numbered folders I develop the games discussed in the CS course, documenting the process as much as possible. It is a lengthy process, but hopefully worth the extra effort

- in the `Practice` folder I create additional demos to rehearse the concepts introduced in the course â€” and learn plenty more. I've managed 15+ titles so far, and I'm proud of at least half of them

- in the `Utils` folder I introduce a few helper projects. How to work with object-oriented programming, how to manage game state, how to benefit from a timer library. The `Practice` folder ows a lot to these utilities
