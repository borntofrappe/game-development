# game-development

With this folder I set out to explore in the alluring world of game development, starting from [CS50's Intro to Game Development](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbluXJKKbCIb4xd7fcRkpzoz).

- in the numbered folders I develop the games introduced in the course.

- in the `Practice` folder I create additional demos to solidify the lessons learned

- in the `Showcase` folder I include `.gif` files to highlight the projects with a few frames

- in the `Utils` folder I try to explan some of the constructs used throughout the different projects
