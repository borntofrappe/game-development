The goal of this repo starts out simple: follow [this introduction course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbluXJKKbCIb4xd7fcRkpzoz) to learn about game development.

In the numbered folders, I follow the course to recreate the presented games.

In the _Games_ folder, I repeat the concepts by creating either a variant of the proposed games, or new games altogether.
