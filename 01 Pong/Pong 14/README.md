# Pong 13

There isn't any update 13 in the video, but before diving into the assignment I decided to have a folder in which the final project is stored. You can take the lua files which follow, place them alongside the `Resources` folder and have the a game of Pong run.

Two players, both controlled by user input. Through the `w`, `s` and through the `up` and `down` keys.
