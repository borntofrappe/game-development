# Resources

Here you find the `lua` files, the `ttf` font and the `wav` audio files which are used in the application, and repeated after the update in which they are introduced.

To avoid repetition, they are centralized in this repo and used mainly by the final version of the project.

List of resources:

- **sounds**; the audio files used in the game;

- **class.lua**; a library which allows to define and work with classes;

- **push.lua**; a library to alter the default resolution and create a more retro look;

- **font.ttf**; the font being used in the application.
