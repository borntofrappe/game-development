The first video introduces the lua programming language and the love2d environment by creating the game Pong.

The project is organized as follows:

- in each folder _Pong \*_ you find the game developed one feature at a time. In each _README.md_ file(s), I annotate how the code changes, and the lessons I learnt catching up with the video. Pay attention: the folders do not include the resources from the _res_ folder, so running the scripts without first adding the necessary files won't work

- in _Pong – Final_ you find the final version of the game

- in _Pong – Assignment_ you find the game with the changes required by the assignment
