The first video introduces the lua programming language and the love2d environment by creating the game Pong.

The project is organized as follows:

- in each folder **Pong \*** you find the game developed one feature at a time. In the `README.md` file(s), I annotate how the code changes, and the lessons I learn catching up with the video. Pay attention: the folders do not include the resources from the **res** folder, so running the scripts without first adding the necessary files won't work

- in **Pong – Final** you find the final version of the game

- in **Pong – Assignment** you find the game with the changes required by the assignment
