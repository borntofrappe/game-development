# Super Mario Bros 1

_Please note:_ `main.lua` depends on a few assets in the `res` folder. Consider copy-pasting the resources from `Super Mario Bros â€” Final`.

## Entity

The lecturer organizes the code to have _entities_, a helper structure to accommodate both the player and snails. With this update, I create the `Entity` class to have the player inherit its functionality. I am only interested in implementing the features developed so far, which means having the player move, jump, but not react to the surrounding environment; this last feat will be the topic of a future update.

### init

The class is initialized with a `def` table, which contains the necessary information:

- `x`, `y`; coordinates

- `width`, `height`; dimensions

- `texture`; a string describing the png image in the global `gTexture` and `gFrames`

- `stateMachine`; a state machine describing the player. This is actually important to warrant a separate section (see below)

- `map`; the table describing the structure of the level

### update

Just like the game, the entity is updated through its respective state machine.

```lua
function Entity:update(dt)
    self.stateMachine:update(dt)
end
```

The individual states have therefore a structure similar to the one developed for the `StartState` or `PlayState`, and feature an `update` function describing how to update the entity.

### changeState

The game moves between the individual states for the entity with the `changeState` function. This one mirrors the behavior of the `:change` function first introduced with the game's state.

```lua
function Entity:changeState(state, params)
    self.stateMachine:change(state, params)
end
```

### render

With the `render` function the entity uses the texture described in `self.texture` to target the specific image. For the actual quad, it uses the same value, meaning the tables must have matching keys, and the current animation.

```lua
function Entity:render()
    love.graphics.draw(gTextures[self.texture], gFrames[self.texture][self.currentAnimation:getCurrentFrame()], self.x, self.y)
end
```

Less relevant for the update, the direction is also used to flip the sprite when moving to the left.

### currentAnimation

The `render` method uses a specific quad through the variable `self.currentAnimation`, but its value is not set in the `Entity` class. Each state sets up the animation in the `init` method.

```lua
function PlayerFallingState:init(player)
    self.animation = Animation {
        frames = {3},
        interval = 1
    }
    self.player.currentAnimation = self.animation
end
```

This is reasonable as the animation makes sense only in the context of the individual states.

## State machines

As prefaced in a previous section, the logic of the entities is managed with a state machine. The process is quite similar to the state machine for the entire game.

Dedicated files, like `PlayerWalkingState` and `PlayerIdleState`, describe how the entity behaves, what kind of input produces which kind of effect. Taking for example `PlayerWalkingState`:

- have the player move in the direction described by the `self.direction`

- move to the idle state when the left and right keys are released

## Player

By looking at how the player is first initialized, it's possible to see how the individual states consider as input the player itself.

```lua
StateMachine {
    ['idle'] = function() return PlayerIdleState(self.player) end,
    ...
}
```

This is to give access to the player in the state, and modify its position, appearance _from_ the state itself.

The different states seems to share a few commonalities:

- initialize the player with the input variable

  ```lua
  function PlayerWalkingState:init(player)
    self.player = player
  end
  ```

- initialize an animation and set the `currentAnimation` for the player to said animation

  ```lua
  function PlayerWalkingState:init(player)
    self.animation =
      Animation(
        {
          frames = {10, 11},
          interval = 0.1
        }
    )
    self.player.currentAnimation = self.animation
  end
  ```

- develop how the player behaves in the `update` function

  ```lua
  function PlayerWalkingState:update(dt)
  end
  ```

### IdleState

In the idle state:

- check if the right or left key is being pressed, in which case move to the walking state

- check if the space key was pressed, in which case move to the jumping state

### WalkingState

In the walking state:

- update the animation, as the animation actually includes more than a single frame

- check if both the right and left key are released, in which case move to the idle sate

- check if the space key was pressed, in which case move to the jumping state. This is exactly like for the idle state

- update the player to move left or right, depending on the actual key

Note that the horizontal movement is limited to the beginning/end of the level in the `PlayState`,

```lua
if self.player.x <= 0 then
  self.player.x = 0
elseif self.player.x >= self.width * TILE_SIZE - self.player.width then
  self.player.x = self.width * TILE_SIZE - self.player.width
end
```

### JumpState

In the jump state:

- keep updating the horizontal movement if either the left or right key is being pressed

- change `self.player.dy` to have the player move upwards

- update `dy` and `y` to have the player move vertically and as subject to gravity

- move to the falling state in the moment `dy` becomes positive

### FallingState

In the falling state (most similar to the jump state):

- keep updating the player horizontally

- update `dy` and `y` to have the player move vertically and as subject to gravity

- move to the idle or walking state in the moment the player finds the coordinate of the ground

Differentiating between jumping and falling state seems trivial, but it is actually most important in terms of gameplay. Consider how the interaction with game object changes as the player is moving upwards, for instance to hit a block, or downwards, for instance to stomp an enemy.

## Inheritance and self

In terms of implementation, it's important to note that the player is initialized in the play state describing the values in the `def` table.

```lua
self.player =
    Player(
    {
      x = VIRTUAL_WIDTH / 2 - PLAYER_WIDTH / 2,
      y = TILE_SIZE * (ROWS_SKY - 1) - PLAYER_HEIGHT,
      width = PLAYER_WIDTH,
      height = PLAYER_HEIGHT,
      texture = "character",
      stateMachine = StateMachine(
        {
          ["idle"] = function()
            return PlayerIdleState(self.player)
          end,
          ...
        }
      )
    }
  )
```

`Player` itself inherits from `Entity`, but uses its functions with the following syntax:

```lua
function Player:init(def)
  Entity.init(self, def)
end
```

The player does not use `Entity:init(def)`, because in this instance `self` would refer to `Entity`, not `Player`. It is necessary to explicitly use the argument in the `.init` function.

In the list of dependencies included in `Dependency.lua`, be sure to require the entity class _before_ the player class. In the wrong order the player doesn't have a class from which to inherit.
