The fifth video covers a 2D platformer inspired by Super Mario Bros.

## Topics

- tile maps

- 2D animation

- procedural level generation

- platformer physics

- basic AI

- powerups

## Project structure

The game is introduced by a series of demos discussing specific topics. These are developed in the "Prep" folder:

1. _Tiles_, how to render tiles and fake movement with horizontal scroll

2. _Character_, how to render, move, jump and animate the sprite making up the character

3. _Level_, how to generate a level with different features

From these demos, there is a considerable learning curve to develop the full game, and the different _Super Mario Bros \*_ demos are my way to build the game in increments.

In _Super Mario Bros — Final_ find the version of the game most closely resembling the one introduced in the video.

In _Super Mario Bros — Assignment_ find the final version of the game, incorporating the assignment as well.
