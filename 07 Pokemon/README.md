## 07 Pokemon

The eight title in the course introduces role-playing games with a demo inspired by the Pokemon series.

## Topics

- state stacks, an alternative to state machines

  The idea is to have a series of states _stacked_ one atop the other. Consider for instance having a field state, displaying the level, and a dialog state displaying a message above the level.

- turn-based systems

- graphical user interfaces, or GUIs, presenting information in panels, text boxes

- RPG mechanics, like damage, experience points

## Project structure

The game is developed in increments, but start from `StateStack`. This folder describes the concept of the stack used throughout the game.

In `Pokemon â€” Final` you find a working demo closely resembling the one proposed in the video. Be warned, the way I developed some of the features differs considerably from the lecturer's implementation.
