Wrap up the progress achieved with `Pokemon 12`

# Updates

- add audio files

- tween pokemons as they

  - as they attack, move toward the opposing side

  - as they receive damage, nudge away from the opponent

  - as they are defeated, launch beyond the window's edges

  _Please note_: the coordinates describing the ellipses are modified so that the animation doesn't affect their position
