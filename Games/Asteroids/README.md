# Asteroids

Recreate the popular game, taking inspiration from the Game Boy version, but starting with polygons instead of a spritesheet depicting the elements of the game.

## Project structure

In its first rendition, the game is structured as follows:

- "main.lua" represents the entry point for the application

- the "src" folder contains additional files. These describe the components of the game, as well as "Dependencies.lua", which includes every single file and is required by "main.lua".
