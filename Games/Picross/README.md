# [Picross](https://github.com/borntofrappe/game-development/projects/2)

Create a demo developing the concept of picross, a puzzle game in which the player fills a grid based on the instructions given on the side of each row and column, and in order to draw a stylized picture.

## Topics

- keyboard and touch input, similarly to _Match Three_

- levels based on data, similarly to _Angry Birds_. The idea is to have a table collect the design of the levels through `x`s and `o`s, and have the script create the associated grid at startup
