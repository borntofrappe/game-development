# Surround

A game for two players, where each player is asked to surround the opposing side and have it collide against a solid trail. It is a small game, introduced to explore the section of Love2D wiki discussing [the canvas](https://love2d.org/wiki/Canvas).

## Prep

In the `Canvas` folder I develop a few demos to illustrate how a canvas works in the context of Love2D. Refer to the dedicated markdown document for more information.
