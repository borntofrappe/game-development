# Surround

A game for two players, where each player fills the white background with a distinct color, and the game ends as one of the two sides collides with a trail or exits the world.

## Canvas

The project is created to practice with the [Canvas](https://love2d.org/wiki/Canvas) from the Love2D wiki. The topic is first introduced `Canvas` , with a couple of small, independent demos, and is finally used in `PlayState`, but also `GameoverState`.
