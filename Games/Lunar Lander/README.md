# Lunar Lander

The goal of this project is to recreate the [Atari game Lunar Lander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander), using Box2D and a noise function to produce terrain.

## Noise

Noise functions are useful well beyond terrain generation. To this end, I use the `Noise` folder to create a series of demos, of experiments and playgrounds to showcase how these functions work in the context of Lua and Love2D.
