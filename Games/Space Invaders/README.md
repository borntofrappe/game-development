Recreate the popular game _Space Invaders_, taking inspiration from the art style of the super game boy variant.

## Update 0 â€” title

Render a screen with the title, above a basic instruction on how to proceed. Use the `timer` module from the **knife** library, to animate the scene.

For the title, I created an image with GIMP and the following color palette:

- #24bf61

- #fcc721

- #e67e00

It's quite a poorly designed image, but for the current update, it will do.

For the font, I decided to use [DM Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono?sort=popularity&category=Monospace&preview.text=10+POINTS&preview.text_type=custom).
