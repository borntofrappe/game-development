# Bouldy

The game has a ball roll inside of a maze, and gaining speed for every cell of uninterrupted movement. With enough speed, the ball is able to destroy the maze's gate and pass through the otherwise solid constraint. It is an excellent excuse to implement a maze structure with the recursive backtracker algorithm and rehearse Love2D particle system.
