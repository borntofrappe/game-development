# Petri Dish

The goal is to create a game inspired by [agar.io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar.io), where a large cell assimilates neighboring, smaller units by entering into contact with them.

Using `love.math.noise` then, the goal is to animate the cell to draw a circle, and show a blob-like animation every time a contact is registered.

## Noise

In the `Noise` folder I explore `love.math.noise` with the ultimate goal of building the foundation for the blob-like animation.
