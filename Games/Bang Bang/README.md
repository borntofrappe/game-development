# Bang Bang

The goal is to recreate the Windows 3 game Bangbang, where two players fire cannon balls with the goal of hitting the opposing sides.

In so doing, I intendo to practice with `love.math.noise`, as well as basic trigonometry for the sine or cosine functions and basic physics for the angle, velocity and wind resistance applied to a shot.
