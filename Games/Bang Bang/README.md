# Bang Bang

The goal is to recreate the Windows 3 game Bangbang, where two players fire cannon balls with the goal of hitting the opposing sides.

## Prep

In dedicated folders I develop the building blocks behind the game.

- `Terrain` creates a few demos to explore how to render terrain and cannoball holes.

- `Physics` considers the trajectory of the cannonballs, considering a velocity `v` and angle `theta`
