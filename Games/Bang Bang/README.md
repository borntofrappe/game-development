# Bang Bang

The goal is to recreate the Windows 3 game Bangbang, where two players fire cannon balls with the goal of hitting the opposing sides.

## Prep

In dedicated folders I develop the building blocks for the final project.

- `Terrain` explores how to render the game's terrain and cannoball holes

- `Physics` considers projectile motion and the rules governing the game
