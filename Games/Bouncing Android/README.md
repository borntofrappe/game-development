With this game I set out to take the lessons learned from _01 Pong_ and _02 Flappy Bird_ to replicate the flappy bird-like game provided on android devices running the lollipop version.

## BA 0 — Static

Render the assets making up the background of the game.

## BA 1 – Parallax

Move the assets in the background and with a different speed.

## BA 2 — Android

Define a table for the android. Render at the center of the screen.

## BA 3 — It moves

Add movement for the android, in the form of gravity, bouncing and change in the image's own rotation.
