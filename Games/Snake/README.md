# Snake

Recreate the popular game starting with shapes from the `love.graphics` module.

## Debug

In order to develop the game, I decided to add helper constructs like the logic behind the `renderGrid` function. With this one, the idea is to draw a series of lines to show the potential movement of the snake, in a pixelated matrix of `CELL_SIZE` width and height.
