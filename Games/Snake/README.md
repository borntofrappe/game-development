# Snake

## Movement

The idea is to have each square move where the previous square _was_.

For the font I've chosen [Gugi](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gugi).

I've decided to include helper structures to ease the development of the game. These are mapped to specific keys.

| Key    | Brief                               |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| g or G | Toggle grid lines                   |
| r or R | Randomly reposition snake and fruit | -->
