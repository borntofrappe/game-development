# Snake

As to solidify the concepts acquired in the first round of videos in the 'Introduction to Game Development' course, followed on the freecodecamp youtube channel and published by the CS50 class @harvard, I set out to re-create the age-old game 'Snake'. For starters I will focus less on the design of the game and more on what it takes to have a `main.lua` file deploy the desired result. I will therefore document the game from an empty `lua` file, even if at a later stage I might expand the codebase to consider multiple files, required by the central `main.lua` location.
