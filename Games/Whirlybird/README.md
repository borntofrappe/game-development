## Design

The font is the same font introduced in _Pong_.

For the spritesheet, refer to the following table.

| Visual         | x   | y   | width | height |
| -------------- | --- | --- | ----- | ------ |
| Player         | 0   | 0   | 39    | 33     |
| Player Falling | 33  | 0   | 39    | 45     |
| Hat(s)         | 39  | 0   | 21    | 12     |
| Platform(s)    | 39  | 39  | 39    | 15     |

The platforms have a different height, but are all designed in a box 63 wide by 24 tall. Since the player can only bounce on the top of a platform, having a transparent section at the bottom does not influence the gameplay; this simplifies the way the quads are created from the spritesheet.

For the color palette, refer to the following table.

| Color      | r   | g   | b   |
| ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
| background | 255 | 255 | 255 |
| grey       | 91  | 96  | 99  |
| blue       | 69  | 141 | 241 |
| green      | 42  | 173 | 83  |
| yellow     | 239 | 190 | 52  |
| red        | 238 | 61  | 73  |

Remember that love2d accepts color values in the [0, 1] range, as opposed to the [0, 255] range.
