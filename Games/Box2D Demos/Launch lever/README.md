#Launch lever

The idea is to experiment with dynamic, kinematic and static objects to develop a game in which the player manages a lever similarly to a catapult. As the mouse is pressed, a circle with an increasing radius is generated in the window, and as the mouse is released, the circle is made into a dynamic body. This one falls as subject to gravity, interacting with the world's environment.
