# Box2D Demos

The goal of this folder is to re-introduce the physics library Box2D, as first seen in the game `07 Angry Birds`. The library is used in the context of the Love2D game engine, and specifically looking at the code behind the `love.physics` module.

## Resources

- [Love2D physics](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.physics). The wiki describes in detail how the module works.

- [Box2D Physics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy4FyZtCHsZc_K0BrXzxfE). The playlist from [TheCodingTrain Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) illustrates the ideas reproduced in the folder. It provides more of inspiration than actual code, as the physics engine is introduced in the context of Processing (java).
