# Bowling lane

The idea is to develop a stylized version of a bowling lane, with a ball in the lower section of the window, and a series of pins in the upper portion. The ball moves toward the pins through mouse or key input, applying an impulse as input is released. The intensity of the impulse is determined by how long the mouse cursor or key are pressed, and is applied through the `body:setLinearImpulse` function.
