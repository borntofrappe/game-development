# Bowling lane

The idea is to develop a stylized version of a bowling lane, with a ball on the lower section of the window, and a series of pins on the upper portion. The ball moves toward the pins through mouse or key input, changig the direction of the force and its intensity. The demo is essentially a dumbed-down version of the game _07 Angry Birds_.
