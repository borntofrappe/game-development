Seventh episode in the continuing saga is a physics-based game inspired by Angry Birds.

## Topics

- physics and box2d

- mouse input

## Project structure

The game is developed through several folders. In addition to those dedicated to the game as proposed in the video, you find additional demos to practice with the physics module and the box2d library (`Physics`, `Physics Collision` and `Ball Pit`).

After the incremental folders (labeled `Angry Birds n`), you finally find two versions describing the complete game:

- `Angry Birds — Final` details the game as presented in the course

- `Angry Birds — Assignment` adds the features requested by the assignment
