# Match Three 4

_Please note:_ `main.lua` depends on a few assets in the `res` folder. Consider copy-pasting the resources from `Match Three â€” Final`.

## Re-tiling

Once the matches are removed and the existing tiles are updated, it is necessary to include new tiles in place of the old ones.

Once again, loop column by column and row by row. In the code I proceed in reverse row order, but as the tiles are included in the same instant, there's fundamentally no difference.

```lua
for x = 1, self.columns do
  for y = self.rows, 1, -1 do

  end
end
```

In the loop, include a new instance of the `Tile` class in place of `nil` values.

```lua
if not self.tiles[y][x] then
  self.tiles[y][x] = Tile(x, y)
end
```

## Timer

The previous code works to include new tiles, but immediately. Since the tiles are animated when they are swapped, or when they move downwards to the empty spaces, the idea is to animate the appearance of the new tiles as well.

This is achieved by modifying the `y` coordinate, so that the tiles are effectively positioned above the board.

```lua
self.tiles[y][x].y = -1
```

With a tween then, the tiles fall into their rightful place.

```lua
Timer.tween(
  0.2,
  {
    [self.tiles[y][x]] = {y = y}
  }
)
```

And this covers the animation. I've decided to include `Timer.after` function to delay the operation, but the core of the update is in the `Timer.tween` function.
