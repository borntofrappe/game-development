The fourth video moves on to create a game in which you match tiles of the same shape and color.

## Topics

- anonymous functions

- tweening

- timers

- clearing matches

- procedural grids

- sprite art and palettes

## Project structure

In _Match Three — Final_ find the version of the game as developed alongside the video.

In _Match Three — Assignment_ find the version including the assignments.

That being said, the game is developed in _Match Three \*_ folders. There are also additional demos to discuss dedicated topics:

1. _Timer_, how to consider time events

2. _Tween_, how to interpolate between values over time

3. _Chain_, how to have multiple operations in sequence

4. _Swap_, how to swapping two tiles

These are saved in the _Prep_ folder, and chronologically precede the games' folders.
