## 03 Match Tree

The fourth video moves on to create a game in which you match tiles of the same shape and color.

## Topics

- anonymous functions

- tweening, interpolating a value over time

- timers, to have something happen at intervals, or after a certain amount of time

- solving matches and repopulating the level

- procedural grids, generating levels with some degree of randomness

- sprite art and palettes, using a restricted set of color

## Increments

The `Prep` folder includes several demos to discuss different topics:

- `Timer`: consider time events

  0.  count the number of seconds through `dt` and dedicated variables

  1.  keep track of multiple intervals with multiple variables

  2.  set up multiple intervals with the `knife/timer` library

- `Tween`: interpolate between values over time

  0. move a static image computing the distance over time

  1. move multiple images at different rates and through different variables

  2. move multiple images with the `knife/timer` library

- `Chain`, how to have multiple operations in sequence

- `Swap`, how to swap two tiles

Past these folders, the game is developed in `Match Three *` folders.
