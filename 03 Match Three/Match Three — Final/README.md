Add audio and finalize game.

## Audio

The audio is included in a global table `gSounds`, specifying the path of the audio files. I've decided to focus on:

- music3

- clock, every time the countdown is decremented

- error, when you try to select a tile outside of the board

- game-over, when entering the matching state

- match, when matching three or more tiles of the same color

- next-level, every time the score surpasses the goal

- select, to select the options in the introductory menu and the when selecting the tiles
