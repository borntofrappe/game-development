# Match Three â€” Final

With respect to the final increment the final version adds audio through the `gSounds` table.

I've decided to focus on:

- `music.mp3` as a looping soundtrack

- `clock.wav` every time the countdown is decremented

- `error.wav` when you try to select a tile outside of the board

- `game-over.wav`, when entering the matching state

- `match.wav`, when matching three or more tiles of the same color

- `next-level.wav`, every time the score surpasses the goal

- `select.wav`, to select the options in the introductory menu and the when selecting the tiles
