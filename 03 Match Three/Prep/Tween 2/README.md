# Tween 2

_Please note:_ `main.lua` depends on a few assets in the `res` folder. Consider copy-pasting the resources from `Match Three â€” Final`.

The approach described in `Tween 0` and `Tween 1` works, but becomes brittle the more values you need to change over time.

With this script, the goal is to change the position, but also the opacity of the images. It serves to illustrate the usefulness of the `knife` library and the `timer` module.

## Opacity

Change the opacity with the fourth argument of the `setColor` function.

```lua
love.graphics.setColor(1, 1, 1, alpha)
love.graphics.draw(BIRD_IMAGE, bird.x, bird.y)
```

Without the module mentioned above, you'd modify the opacity with an additional variable.

```lua
function love.load()
    for k, bird in pairs(birds) do
      -- previous attributes
      bird.opacity = 0
    end
end

function love.update(dt)
  if timer < TIMER_MAX then
    timer = timer + dt
    for k, bird in pairs(birds) do
      -- update bird.x
      bird.opacity = math.min(1, bird.opacity + 1 / bird.rate * dt)
    end
  end
end

function love.draw()
  for k, bird in pairs(birds) do
    love.graphics.setColor(1, 1, 1, bird.opacity)
    love.graphics.draw(BIRD_IMAGE, bird.x, bird.y)
  end
end
```

See the code in `min.lua` for reference.

## Timer

The relevant function is here `Timer.tween`. It accepts as argument a rate, and a table defining the tween's own rules.

For instance and to modify the horizontal coordinate.

```lua
Timer.tween(bird.rate, {
  [bird] = { x = VIRTUAL_WIDTH - BIRD_WIDTH }
})
```

This has the effect of modifying the `x` attribute of the `bird` entity.

To modify the opacity as well, all you need is another variable-value pair in the table describing which values to change.

```lua
Timer.tween(bird.rate, {
  [bird] = { x = VIRTUAL_WIDTH - BIRD_WIDTH, opacity = 1 }
})
```

In both instances, the `update` function needs to update the `Timer` object only.

```lua
function love.update(dt)
  Timer.update(dt)
end
```
