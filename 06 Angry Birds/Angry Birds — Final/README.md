# Angry Birds â€” Final

From `Angry Birds 11` the game is updated as follows:

- add audio files

- add a level with a different structure

- consider more options for the background

- render a row of tiles at the bottom of the screen

- display a message as the target is destroyed. Move back to the start state after an arbitrary countdown

- (personal preference) reduce the size of the window
