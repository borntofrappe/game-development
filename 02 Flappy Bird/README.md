# Flappy Bird

For the second project in the Introductory to Game Development course, the game is **flappy bird**. The topics covered, and hopefully learned by creating a replica are:

- sprites (including images);

- inifinite scrolling (moving the background giving the illusion of movement);

- procedural generation (as to create pipes at various heights);

- state machines (a class to transition between states);

- mouse input.

## Project structure

Like for **Pong**, this game will be created in increments, in folders labeled fittingly 'FP 0', 'FP 1' and so forth. The repo also has a **Resources** folder, in which any file which is not a `.lua` file coded by hand will be included. What's more, the resources folder mirrors the actual structure in which I work locally (and the structure of the folder I feed to the Love2D .exe file).

Each sub-folder will have its own README, in which I'll try to detail the purpose of the code found in the existing files. I will include only those files which are altered between updates and try my best to explain the reasoning behind the addition. Unlike for Pong, in which I mostly read the source code and tried to grasp each line of code, I will try to code along the lecturer and write my own solutions.

Even when a snippet is meant to be exactly the same, I will avoid copy-paste to reinforce my learning of the subject.

## Update & Assignment

There actually isn't any update 13, but I decided to create one for the assignment given by the lecturer to expand on the game.

These are tasks that go beyond the scope of the video, but it is teaching and also entertaining to indulge in them.
