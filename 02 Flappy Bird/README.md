# Flappy Bird

For the second project in the Introductory to Game Development course, the game is **flappy bird**. The topics covered, and hopefully learned by creating a replica are:

- sprites (including images);

- inifinite scrolling (moving the background giving the illusion of movement);

- procedural generation (as to create pipes at various heights);

- state machines (a class to transition between states);

- mouse input.
