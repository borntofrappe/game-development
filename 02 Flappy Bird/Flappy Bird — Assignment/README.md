# Flappy Bird — Assignment

Following [the goals from the assignment](https://docs.cs50.net/ocw/games/assignments/1/assignment1.html):

- randomize the gap between pipes

- randomize the interval at which pairs of pipes spawn

- when a player enters the ScoreState, award them a “medal” via an image displayed along with the score. Choose 3 different ones, as well as the minimum score needed for each one

- implement a pause feature, such that the user can simply press “P” (or some other key) and pause the state of the game. When pausing the game, a simple sound effect should play. At the same time, the music should pause, and once the user presses P again, the gameplay and the music should resume just as they were. Display a pause icon in the middle of the screen, so as to make it clear the game is paused
